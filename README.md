## Getting Started

To get started with the PeakRDL SoCGen project, follow these steps to test the examples:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HEP-SoC/PeakRDL-socgen.git
cd peakrdl_socgen/examples/apb_test
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
```

Now the APB example is configured (i.e., the python venv and the make targets have been generated by cmake).
